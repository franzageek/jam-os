## Description
JamOS is an operating system coded in **Batch**. Whole system is based on few files that interact with each others. This simulator **doesn't affect** your computer data more than it should, so **don't worry about** *losing data, infecting your computer*, etc.

## Installation
JamOS' installation is very **quickly & simple**. After downloading **the `jamosX.XX.X.zip` folder**, you just have to extract it and **start `JamOS Installer.bat`** . 
The installation will begin. You just need to follow the steps on screen.

## Usage
JamOS is very simple to use. You can start it by **the `JamOS.bat` file**. After booting up the system, you can use the **JamOS Command Line** wich lets you to perform some actions.

## Fixing errors
If there is any error during the installation process, the **blue screen** will appear, showing information about errors etc.
Most of the time the error is "Missing file" but don't worry: just download the file again from our repo and place it in the directory it belongs to.
If you are sure you have all the files in order, but the blue screen still appears, **please open an issue**. And if you see that JamOS isn't working properly (bugs everywhere, glitches and system errors) **please open an issue**.
